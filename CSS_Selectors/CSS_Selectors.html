<!-- ## Selector identification

Identify the selectors in each style and what HTML element(s) they target.

### 1
The 'p' tag is the selector in this case.


p {
  color: white;
}
```

### 2
In this scenario the 'span' tag is what is being targerted.


span {
  padding: 15px;
}
```

### 3
In this case the table tags with td tags are the ones that are going to be targeted in this case. 


table td {
  color: #222;
}
```

### 4
In this problem all elements with a class of "lede-selection" that have an id of 'left-side' are what is going to be targeted


.lede-section #left-side {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### 5
This is targeting specifically elements with an id of "section-9" 


#section-9 {
  display: block
  text-decoration: underline;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## What's different about the following three selectors?

### 6
In this its targeting elements according to their specific parent elements by separating the two selectors with a space

.fewd25-page-section .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
```


### 7
This situation tackles mulitple classes the classes being ".fewd25-page-section" and ".another-class"


.fewd25-page-section, .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
```


### 8

In this case it is targeting only elements that match all of the selectors included. 
.fewd25-page-section.another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
``` -->
